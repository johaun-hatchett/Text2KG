"['prokaryotic', 'eukaryotic']",Cells fall into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic.
"['Bacteria', 'Archaea', 'prokaryotes']","We classify only the predominantly single-celled organisms Bacteria and Archaea as prokaryotes (pro- = ""before""; -kary- = ""nucleus"")."
"['eukaryotes', 'plants', 'animals', 'fungi', 'protists']","Animal cells, plants, fungi, and protists are all eukaryotes (eu- = ""true"")."
"['plasma membrane', 'cytoplasm', 'DNA', 'ribosomes']","All cells share four common components: 1) a plasma membrane, an outer covering that separates the cell's interior from its surrounding environment; 2) cytoplasm, consisting of a jelly-like cytosol within the cell in which there are other cellular components; 3) DNA, the cell's genetic material; and 4) ribosomes, which synthesize proteins."
"['prokaryotes', 'eukaryotic cells']","However, prokaryotes differ from eukaryotic cells in several ways."
"['prokaryote', 'single-celled', 'organism', 'nucleus', 'membrane-bound organelle']","A prokaryote is a simple, mostly single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other membrane-bound organelle."
['eukaryotes'],We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes.
"['Prokaryotic DNA', 'cell', 'nucleoid', 'Figure 4.5']",Prokaryotic DNA is in the cell's central part: the nucleoid (Figure 4.5).
['prokaryotic cell'],This figure shows the generalized structure of a prokaryotic cell.
"['prokaryotes', 'chromosomal DNA', 'nucleoid', 'ribosomes', 'cell membrane', 'cell wall']","All prokaryotes have chromosomal DNA localized in a nucleoid, ribosomes, a cell membrane, and a cell wall."
['bacteria'],"The other structures shown are present in some, but not all, bacteria."
"['peptidoglycan', 'cell wall', 'polysaccharide capsule', 'prokaryotes', 'Figure 4.5']",Most prokaryotes have a peptidoglycan cell wall and many have a polysaccharide capsule (Figure 4.5).
"['cell wall', 'cell', 'dehydration']","The cell wall acts as an extra layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration."
"['cell', 'capsule']",The capsule enables the cell to attach to surfaces in its environment.
"['prokaryotes', 'flagella', 'pili', 'fimbriae']","Some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae."
"['Flagella', 'locomotion']",Flagella are used for locomotion.
"['Pili', 'conjugation']","Pili exchange genetic material during conjugation, the process by which one bacterium transfers genetic material to another through direct contact."
"['Bacteria', 'fimbriae', 'host cell']",Bacteria use fimbriae to attach to a host cell.
"['contagious illnesses', 'hands']",The most effective action anyone can take to prevent the spread of contagious illnesses is to wash his or her hands.
['Why'],Why?
['microbes'],Because microbes (organisms so tiny that they can only be seen with microscopes) are ubiquitous.
"['doorknobs', 'money', 'hands']","They live on doorknobs, money, your hands, and many other surfaces."
"['microbes', ""sneezer's mucus""]","If someone sneezes into his hand and touches a doorknob, and afterwards you touch that same doorknob, the microbes from the sneezer's mucus are now on your hands."
['microbes'],"If you touch your hands to your mouth, nose, or eyes, those microbes can enter your body and could make you sick."
"['microbes', 'microorganisms']","However, not all microbes (also called microorganisms) cause disease; most are actually beneficial."
"['vitamin K', 'microbes', 'gut', 'ferment', 'beer', 'wine', 'microorganisms']",You have microbes in your gut that make vitamin K. Other microorganisms are used to ferment beer and wine.
['Microbiologists'],Microbiologists are scientists who study microbes.
['Microbiologists'],Microbiologists can pursue a number of careers.
"['food industry', 'veterinary', 'medical fields']","Not only do they work in the food industry, they are also employed in the veterinary and medical fields."
"['pharmaceutical sector', 'research and development', 'antibiotic sources', 'bacterial infections']","They can work in the pharmaceutical sector, serving key roles in research and development by identifying new antibiotic sources that can treat bacterial infections."
"['Environmental microbiologists', 'genetically engineered microbes', 'pollutants', 'soil', 'groundwater', 'hazardous elements', 'contaminated sites']","Environmental microbiologists may look for new ways to use specially selected or genetically engineered microbes to remove pollutants from soil or groundwater, as well as hazardous elements from contaminated sites."
"['bioremediation technologies', 'microbes']",We call using these microbes bioremediation technologies.
"['Microbiologists', 'bioinformatics', 'computer models', 'bacterial epidemics']","Microbiologists can also work in the bioinformatics field, providing specialized knowledge and insight for designing, developing, and specificity of computer models of, for example, bacterial epidemics."
"['prokaryotic cells', 'eukaryotic cells', 'diameters', 'Figure 4.6']","At 0.1 to 5.0 μm in diameter, prokaryotic cells are significantly smaller than eukaryotic cells, which have diameters ranging from 10 to 100 μm (Figure 4.6)."
['prokaryotes'],The prokaryotes' small size allows ions and organic molecules that enter them to quickly diffuse to other parts of the cell.
['prokaryotic cell'],"Similarly, any wastes produced within a prokaryotic cell can quickly diffuse."
"['eukaryotic cells', 'intracellular transport']","This is not the case in eukaryotic cells, which have developed different structural adaptations to enhance intracellular transport."
"['logarithmic scale', 'microbes']",This figure shows relative sizes of microbes on a logarithmic scale (recall that each unit of increase in a logarithmic scale represents a 10-fold increase in the quantity measured).
"['prokaryotic', 'eukaryotic']","Small size, in general, is necessary for all cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic."
['JSON'],Let's examine why that is so.
['cell'],"First, we'll consider the area and volume of a typical cell."
"['cells', 'sphere']","Not all cells are spherical in shape, but most tend to approximate a sphere."
"['sphere', 'surface area', 'volume']","You may remember from your high school geometry course that the formula for the surface area of a sphere is 4πr2, while the formula for its volume is 4πr3/3."
"['surface area', 'radius', 'volume']","Thus, as the radius of a cell increases, its surface area increases as the square of its radius, but its volume increases as the cube of its radius (much more rapidly)."
"['cell', 'size', 'surface area-to-volume ratio']","Therefore, as a cell increases in size, its surface area-to-volume ratio decreases."
['Figure 4.7'],This same principle would apply if the cell had a cube shape (Figure 4.7).
"['plasma membrane', 'cell', 'diffusion', 'surface area', 'rate', 'volume']","If the cell grows too large, the plasma membrane will not have sufficient surface area to support the rate of diffusion required for the increased volume."
['cell'],"In other words, as a cell grows, it becomes less efficient."
['efficient'],One way to become more efficient is to divide.
['organelles'],Another way is to develop organelles that perform specific tasks.
['eukaryotic cells'],"These adaptations lead to developing more sophisticated cells, which we call eukaryotic cells."
"['cell', 'surface area-to-volume ratio']","Notice that as a cell increases in size, its surface area-to-volume ratio decreases."
['cell'],"When there is insufficient surface area to support a cell's increasing volume, a cell will either divide or die."
"['cell', 'volume', 'surface area', 'ratio']","The cell on the left has a volume of 1 mm3 and a surface area of 6 mm2, with a surface area-to-volume ratio of 6 to 1; whereas, the cell on the right has a volume of 8 mm3 and a surface area of 24 mm2, with a surface area-to-volume ratio of 3 to 1."
"['Prokaryotic cells', 'eukaryotic cells']",Prokaryotic cells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells.
['small cell size'],What advantages might small cell size confer on a cell?
['large cell size'],What advantages might large cell size have?
