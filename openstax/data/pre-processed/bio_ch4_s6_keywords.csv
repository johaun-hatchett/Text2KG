[],No.

"['microfilaments', 'intermediate filaments', 'microtubules', 'cytoskeleton', 'Figure 4.22']","There are three types of fibers within the cytoskeleton: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules (Figure 4.22)."

"['intermediate filaments', 'cell', 'organelles']",There are intermediate filaments throughout the cell that hold organelles in place.
"['cytoskeleton', 'microfilaments', 'protein fibers']","Of the three types of protein fibers in the cytoskeleton, microfilaments are the narrowest."
"['actin', 'cellular movement']","They function in cellular movement, have a diameter of about 7 nm, and are comprised of two globular protein intertwined strands, which we call actin (Figure 4.23)."
"['microfilaments', 'actin filaments']","For this reason, we also call microfilaments actin filaments."
"['actin', 'microfilaments']",Two intertwined actin strands comprise microfilaments.
"['ATP', 'actin', 'myosin']","ATP powers actin to assemble its filamentous form, which serves as a track for the movement of a motor protein we call myosin."
"['actin', 'cell division', 'eukaryotic cells', 'cytoplasmic streaming', 'cell cytoplasm', 'plant cells']","This enables actin to engage in cellular events requiring motion, such as cell division in eukaryotic cells and cytoplasmic streaming, which is the cell cytoplasm's circular movement in plant cells."
"['actin', 'myosin', 'muscle cells']",Actin and myosin are plentiful in muscle cells.
"['actin', 'myosin']","When your actin and myosin filaments slide past each other, your muscles contract."
['Microfilaments'],Microfilaments also provide some rigidity and shape to the cell.
['cell'],"They can depolymerize (disassemble) and reform quickly, thus enabling a cell to change its shape and move."
['White blood cells'],White blood cells (your body's infection-fighting cells) make good use of this ability.
"['infection site', 'pathogen']",They can move to an infection site and phagocytize the pathogen.
"['white blood cell', 'bacteria', 'time-lapse video']","To see an example of a white blood cell in action, watch a short time-lapse video of the cell capturing two bacteria."
"['one', 'other']",It engulfs one and then moves on to the other.
"['intermediate filaments', 'Figure 4.24']",Several strands of fibrous proteins that are wound together comprise intermediate filaments (Figure 4.24).
"['cytoskeleton', 'microfilaments', 'microtubules']","Cytoskeleton elements get their name from the fact that their diameter, 8 to 10 nm, is between those of microfilaments and microtubules."
"['Intermediate filaments', 'fibrous proteins']",Intermediate filaments consist of several intertwined strands of fibrous proteins.
['Intermediate filaments'],Intermediate filaments have no role in cell movement.
['structural'],Their function is purely structural.
"['cell', 'nucleus', 'organelles']","They bear tension, thus maintaining the cell's shape, and anchor the nucleus and other organelles in place."
"['Figure 4.22', 'intermediate filaments']",Figure 4.22 shows how intermediate filaments create a supportive scaffolding inside the cell.
"['cytoskeletal elements', 'intermediate filaments']",The intermediate filaments are the most diverse group of cytoskeletal elements.
"['keratin', 'hair', 'nails', 'skin', 'epidermis']","You are probably most familiar with keratin, the fibrous protein that strengthens your hair, nails, and the skin's epidermis."
['microtubules'],"As their name implies, microtubules are small hollow tubes."
"['α-tubulin', 'β-tubulin', 'microtubule', 'Figure 4.25']","Polymerized dimers of α-tubulin and β-tubulin, two globular proteins, comprise the microtubule's walls (Figure 4.25)."
"['microtubules', 'cytoskeletons']","With a diameter of about 25 nm, microtubules are cytoskeletons' widest components."
"['cell', 'vesicles', 'chromosomes']","They help the cell resist compression, provide a track along which vesicles move through the cell, and pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell."
"['microfilaments', 'microtubules']","Like microfilaments, microtubules can disassemble and reform quickly."
['Microtubules'],Microtubules are hollow.
"['α-tubulin', 'β-tubulin']",Their walls consist of 13 polymerized dimers of α-tubulin and β-tubulin (right image).
"['molecular structure', 'tube']",The left image shows the tube's molecular structure.
"['microtubules', 'flagella', 'cilia', 'centrioles', 'centrosome']","Microtubules are also the structural elements of flagella, cilia, and centrioles (the latter are the centrosome's two perpendicular bodies)."
"['centrosome', 'microtubule-organizing center', 'animal cells']","In animal cells, the centrosome is the microtubule-organizing center."
"['eukaryotic cells', 'flagella', 'cilia', 'prokaryotes']","In eukaryotic cells, flagella and cilia are quite different structurally from their counterparts in prokaryotes, as we discuss below."
"['flagella', 'flagellum', 'plasma membrane', 'sperm', 'Euglena', 'prokaryotes']","The flagella (singular = flagellum) are long, hair-like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and enable an entire cell to move (for example, sperm, Euglena, and some prokaryotes)."
"['cell', 'flagellum']","When present, the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella."
"['cilium', 'plasma membrane']","However, when cilia (singular = cilium) are present, many of them extend along the plasma membrane's entire surface."
"['cilia', 'paramecia', 'Fallopian tubes', 'uterus', 'respiratory tract', 'nostrils']","They are short, hair-like structures that move entire cells (such as paramecia) or substances along the cell's outer surface (for example, the cilia of cells lining the Fallopian tubes that move the ovum toward the uterus, or cilia lining the cells of the respiratory tract that trap particulate matter and move it toward your nostrils.)"
"['flagella', 'cilia', 'microtubules', '9 + 2 array']","Despite their differences in length and number, flagella and cilia share a common structural arrangement of microtubules called a ""9 + 2 array."""
"['flagellum', 'cilium', 'microtubule doublets', 'center', 'Figure 4.26']","This is an appropriate name because a single flagellum or cilium is made of a ring of nine microtubule doublets, surrounding a single microtubule doublet in the center (Figure 4.26)."
"['transmission electron micrograph', 'flagella', 'microtubules', 'microtubule doublets']",This transmission electron micrograph of two flagella shows the microtubules' 9 + 2 array: nine microtubule doublets surround a single microtubule doublet.
